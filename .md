//Build a webpack
I would use the webpack.config.js, the .babelrc and the package.json from your project 2 as a reference.

# Webpack
Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. What that means it that it allows us to import code from files and folders into other files and folders.
Not only that it can also transpile ES6 to ES5, convert SASS to CSS and copy static files from one folder to another. We can even have Webpack refresh the browser window when we save our files, so we don't have keep refreshing manually!
All of these things are required when developing complex JavaScript applications. Having a tool automate these tasks is very helpful.
## npm
npm is a package manager for Node.js projects. It allows developers to install 3rd-party software into their projects using terminal commands. This makes it very easy to install 3rd-party without having to find the resources online.
Node.js is a program which runs JavaScript in the terminal. Although we wont be looking at Node.js in this module, we can still use npm to install libraries for frontend JavaScript like jQuery, Bulma, and most importantly React into our projects.
## Example import syntax
Without a module bundler like Webpack, in order to use, say jQuery in a project, we first have to find the CDN link for jQuery, and add it into our `index.html` file before using it.
With Webpack and npm, we can install jQuery with the following command:
```
npm install jquery
```
Then add it to our JavaScript file like so:
```js
import $ from 'jquery'
```
We can also add CSS frameworks directly into our JavaScript files, and Webpack can add the CSS to the `<head>` of the `index.html` for us:
```js
import 'bulma' // add bulma styles
import $ from 'jquery'
$(() => {
  console.log('jQuery loaded...')
})
```
## Setup
Webpack is a very powerful tool but does require some setup.
### Create a Node.js project
Firstly we need to initialise a Node.js project so that we can use npm:
```
npm init
```
This requires us to answer some questions. Pressing enter will use the default values (the ones in parenthesis). Generally the defaults are fine.
```sh
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.
See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.
Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

About to write to /Users/mickyginger/development/intro-to-webpack/package.json:
{
  "name": "intro-to-webpack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Mike Hayden <mickyginger@gmail.com> (https://github.com/mickyginger)",
  "license": "ISC"
}
Is this OK? (yes)
```
This will generate a `package.json` file, which is used to keep a track of all the npm packages, sometimes called _modules_, used in this project.
### Install Webpack
There are a number of packages we are going to need for webpack:
* `webpack`: the core library
* `webpack-cli`: the terminal commands needed to execute webpack
* `webpack-dev-server`: needed to watch for file changes and refresh the browser
* `html-webpack-plugin`: allows Webpack to add script tags to html files
We can install them with the following command:
```sh
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```
The `--save-dev` tells npm that these packages are for development purposes only.
### Install loaders
Webpack can be configured with _loaders_ which add support for various types of files:
* `babel-loader`: adds support for ES6 files
* `style-loader`: adds CSS to the `<head>` of the `index.html`
* `css-loader`: adds support for CSS files
* `sass-loader`: adds support for SASS/SCSS files
Install like so:
```sh
npm install babel-loader style-loader css-loader sass-loader --save-dev
```
### Install babel
In order to transpile ES6 to ES5 we need to install Babel. Babel, named after the Babel Fish from _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, is a package that does just that.
In order to use it we need to install two packages:
* `@babel/core`: the core library
* `@babel/preset-env`: adds support for the latest version of JavaScript (ES6, ES7, ES8 etc)
Install like so:
```sh
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev
```
We also need to tell babel to use the preset. To do that we need to create a `.babelrc` file, and add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```
### Install `node-sass`
Finally we need a Node.js SASS compiler to compile SCSS to SASS:
```sh
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```
### `node_modules`
npm will install all these packages into a `node_modules` folder which should now have appeared in the project. You will also see that the `package.json` file has been updated to include all these new packages, and there is also a `package-lock.json` file which sets the **specific** version of each package that was installed. This is very useful when it comes to deployment.
### Create an `src` folder
All the code that we write in a Webpack project will be transpiled or compiled at some point. We call the original pre-compiled code, the code that we write, the _source_ code. Once compilation is complete we need to store to compiled code somewhere. The compiled code will ultimately get sent to the browser, the source code will not.
For this reason we need to keep our source code and compiled code separate so we often use an `src` folder to hold our source code and a `dist` or `dest` to hold our compiled code.
With this in mind, let's create our `src` folder. The `dist` folder will be created automatically by Webpack.
```sh
mkdir src
touch src/index.html src/app.js src/style.scss
```
## Configure Webpack
With that in place we can now configure webpack. To do that we need to create a file called `webpack.config.js`. Here is a basic configuration file:
```js
const path = require('path')
const webpack = require('webpack')
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve('dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  devtool: 'source-maps',
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, loader: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ },
      { test: /\.css$/, loader: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'] },
      { test: /\.s(a|c)ss$/, loader: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.resolve('src'),
    hot: true,
    open: true,
    port: 8000,
    watchContentBase: true
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: 'src/index.html',
      filename: 'index.html',
      inject: 'body'
    })
  ]
}
```
| Setting | Meaning |
|:---------|:---------|
| `entry` | Location of the main JavaScript file for the project |
| `output` | Location and filename used to store the compiled code |
| `devtool` | Development helper tool, `source-maps` gives error messages to our source code, rather than the compiled code. This makes debugging easier |
| `module.rules` | The loaders that we want Webpack to use |
| `devServer` | Configuration for `webpack-dev-server` |
| `devServer.contentBase` | Where the source code files are stored |
| `devServer.port` | The port number `webpack-dev-server` will use |
| `devServer.hot` | Whether the hot module replacement plugin will be used, which will refresh the browser when changes are detected |
| `devServer.open` | Whether `webpack-dev-server` should open the browser for you when it starts |
| `devServer.watchContentBase` | Whether `webpack-dev-server` should what for changes in static files like `index.html` |
| `plugins` | Which plugins should be used |
> **Note**: `html-webpack-plugin` is used to automatically add script tags to HTML files
## Usage
With Webpack configured we can now use it. To do so we need to add some scripts to our `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "webpack-config",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "serve": "webpack-dev-server --mode=development",
    "build": "webpack -p"
  },
  "author": "Mike Hayden <mickyginger@gmail.com> (https://github.com/mickyginger)",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.2.2",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.2.3",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.5",
    "css-loader": "^2.1.0",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.2.0",
    "node-sass": "^4.11.0",
    "sass-loader": "^7.1.0",
    "style-loader": "^0.23.1",
    "webpack": "^4.28.3",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.2.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.1.14"
  }
}
```
By adding commands in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` we can use them in the terminal:
```sh
npm serve
```
Will start `webpack-dev-server`, which will open the browser and watch for file changes. It will not compile any code, but instead stores it all in memory.
```sh
npm build
```
Will actually compile our source code. It will create the `dist` folder and add the `bundle.js` file, `index.html` and any CSS files that may have been created. It will not open the browser or watch for file changes.
