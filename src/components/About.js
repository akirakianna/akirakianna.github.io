      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Junior Software Engineer and recent graduate of General Assembly with a focus on full-stack development and our relationship with security.
        Iâ€™ve spent over 7 years in the fashion industry, working for some of the top brands in their sector.
        My experience includes working as a Fraud Analyst which has equipped me with skills such as precise analytical thinking and identifying data patterns.
        I am interested in the interconnection between design and security and how to widen the gap between our online presence and the subsequent rise in fraudulent activity.
        For my next role, I am looking to develop my existing knowledge and skills within a company that encourages learning and growth.
